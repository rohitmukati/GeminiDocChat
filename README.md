GeminiDocChat: Chat with Your PDF Documents
GeminiDocChat is an AI-powered application that allows users to upload PDF documents and interact with them through conversational prompts. Built using Google Gemini for embeddings and chat models, this app extracts text from uploaded PDFs and provides meaningful, context-aware responses to user queries based on the document content. It leverages Langchain for chunking the text and FAISS for similarity search across document chunks.

Features
Upload one or more PDF files.
Automatically extract and process text from PDF files.
Chat with the uploaded documents using prompts.
Get detailed, context-based answers from the PDF using Google's Gemini API.
Handles large documents by splitting them into chunks and performing similarity searches.
Technologies Used
Python
Streamlit: For building the user interface.
PyPDF2: For extracting text from PDFs.
Langchain: For text chunking and managing conversational prompts.
FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search): For efficient vector similarity search.
Google Gemini: For embeddings and conversational AI.
dotenv: For managing environment variables.
Installation
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/geminidocchat.git
cd geminidocchat
Install Dependencies: Install the required Python packages by running:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Set Up Environment Variables: Create a .env file and add your Google API Key:

bash
Copy code
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key
Run the Application: Start the app locally using Streamlit:

bash
Copy code
streamlit run app.py
Usage
Open the Streamlit app.
In the sidebar, upload one or more PDF files.
Click Submit & Process to extract text from the uploaded PDFs.
Enter your question or prompt related to the uploaded documents.
The app will generate a context-based response from the document using the Gemini API.

Code Walkthrough
1. Extracting Text from PDF:
The app uses PyPDF2 to read and extract text from uploaded PDFs. Each PDF is processed, and the text is concatenated for later chunking.

2. Text Chunking:
The extracted text is split into smaller, manageable chunks using Langchain's RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter. This helps the AI process large documents efficiently.

3. Embeddings and Vector Store:
The text chunks are converted into embeddings using Google Gemini's embedding model. These embeddings are stored in a FAISS index for quick similarity search.

4. Conversational Chain:
The app creates a conversational chain using Langchain and ChatGoogleGenerativeAI, with a custom prompt template to ensure detailed and accurate answers based on the document context.

5. Similarity Search:
When a user asks a question, the app performs a similarity search on the FAISS index to retrieve the most relevant document chunks, which are then passed to the conversational chain for generating a response.

Example
Upload PDF: You can upload documents like research papers, user manuals, or contracts.
Ask a Question: Type a question such as, "What is the conclusion of the document?" or "Explain section 2.3 in detail."
Receive Answer: The app will analyze the document and provide a detailed response based on the context.
Future Enhancements
Add support for other document formats (e.g., Word, text).
Improve the conversational chain to handle more complex queries.
Allow the export of conversational histories.
